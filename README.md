# C++ Internship Projects

This repository contains the C++ programs I developed during my internship.  
Each task demonstrates fundamental C++ programming concepts through interactive applications.

# Tasks Included
1. Number Guessing Game
2. Simple Mathematical Calculator
3. To-Do List Application
   
   #  Number Guessing Game

### Description
A simple C++ console game where the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the user tries to guess it with hints provided.

### How to Run
```bash
g++ guess_number.cpp -o guess_number
./guess_number
```

# Simple Mathematical Calculator

### Description
A basic calculator written in C++ that performs arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on user input.

### How to Run
```bash
g++ calculator.cpp -o calculator
./calculator
```

#  To-Do List Application

### Description
A simple console-based task manager where users can add, view, and delete tasks.  
The tasks are stored in a text file (`tasks.txt`) for persistence.

### How to Run
```bash
g++ todo_list.cpp -o todo_list
./todo_list
```
